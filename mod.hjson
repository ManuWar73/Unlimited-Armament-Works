'''
    A port and sequel to Heavy Armament Industries, written in java.
    All development will be implemented here as Heavy Armament Industries has been discontinued and removed from the Mod browser.

    Unlimited Armament Works adds loads of new content, that expands upon vanilla Mindustry, adding more turrets, units, factories, and its own power system, steam Engines! and much more.

    A lot of work and improvements goes into UAW, if you want to show some support or like the content, please give the mod a star on GitHub, Thank you!
